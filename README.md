## 🔧 SQL Compiler Functionality

### Overview

The **SQL Compiler** in Aries Edition is our flagship feature that makes database portability effortless. It intelligently converts SQL syntax from various database systems into SQLite-compatible code, handling type conversions, function mappings, and syntax differences automatically.

### Supported SQL Dialects

- **MySQL** (VARCHAR, AUTO_INCREMENT, etc.)
- **PostgreSQL** (SERIAL, CHARACTER VARYING, etc.)
- **SQL Server** (NVARCHAR, BIGINT, etc.)
- **Oracle** (NUMBER, LONG, CLOB, etc.)
- **Standard SQL** (Universal compatibility)

### How It Works

1. **Type Mapping**: Automatically converts data types from source dialects to SQLite equivalents
2. **Function Translation**: Maps database-specific functions to SQLite-compatible ones
3. **Syntax Normalization**: Handles CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements
4. **Constraint Handling**: Preserves PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL constraints
5. **Comment Removal**: Cleans SQL comments while preserving functionality

### Compiler Features

#### Automatic Type Conversion

```sql
-- MySQL Syntax (Input)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Compiled SQLite Syntax (Output)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    salary REAL,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

#### Function Translation

```sql
-- Standard SQL (Input)
SELECT NOW(), CURRENT_DATE, UPPER(name) 
FROM users;

-- Compiled SQLite Syntax (Output)
SELECT datetime('now'), date('now'), UPPER(name) 
FROM users;
```

#### CREATE OR REPLACE Support

```sql
-- PostgreSQL Syntax (Input)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';

-- Compiled SQLite Syntax (Output)
-- Drops existing view if exists, then creates new one
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS active_users;
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
```

#### Multi-Statement Support

The compiler handles complex statements with multiple operations, preserving transaction integrity:

```sql
-- Input: Mixed MySQL syntax
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(10,2),
    order_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total, order_date) 
VALUES (1, 99.99, '2024-01-15');

-- Compiled: SQLite-compatible
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    total REAL,
    order_date TEXT
);

INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total, order_date) 
VALUES (1, 99.99, '2024-01-15');
```

### Using the Compiler

1. **In SQL Editor**: Type or paste your SQL from any database system
2. **Automatic Compilation**: The compiler automatically processes queries before execution
3. **Preview Compiled SQL**: Right-click → "Compile SQL" to see the converted syntax
4. **Validation**: Built-in validation ensures compiled SQL is syntactically correct

### Supported Data Types

| Source Type | SQLite Type | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| VARCHAR(n) | TEXT | All string types unified |
| CHAR(n) | TEXT | Fixed-length becomes TEXT |
| INT, INTEGER | INTEGER | All integer variants |
| BIGINT | INTEGER | 64-bit integers |
| DECIMAL, NUMERIC | REAL | Floating-point numbers |
| FLOAT, DOUBLE | REAL | Floating-point precision |
| DATE | TEXT | ISO-8601 format |
| DATETIME | TEXT | ISO-8601 format |

## 🤖 AI Functionality Explained

Aries Edition comes with a comprehensive AI suite powered by Google's Gemini, designed to make database management intuitive and accessible. Here's how each AI feature works:

### 1. AI Query Generation

**Generate SQL from Natural Language**

Simply describe what you want, and AI generates the perfect SQL query for you. It understands context, relationships, and can work with multiple languages.

**Example Usage:**

```
User Prompt: "Show me all customers who spent more than $1000 last month"
```

**AI Response:**
```sql
SELECT c.*, SUM(o.total) as total_spent
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= date('now', '-1 month')
GROUP BY c.id
HAVING SUM(o.total) > 1000
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- Explanation: Joins customers with orders, filters by last month, 
-- groups by customer, and shows only those with total > $1000
```

**Multi-Language Support:**

```
Tamil: "2023-ல் $1000க்கு மேல் வாங்கிய வாடிக்கையாளர்களைக் காட்டு"
Hindi: "2023 में $1000 से अधिक खरीदने वाले ग्राहकों को दिखाएं"
French: "Afficher les clients qui ont acheté plus de 1000$ en 2023"
```

All produce the same accurate SQL result!

### 2. AI Query Modification

**Refine Existing Queries Intelligently**

Already have a query? Ask AI to modify it:

```
Current Query: SELECT * FROM users

AI Prompt: "Add filter for age > 25 and sort by name"

Result: SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25 ORDER BY name
```

### 3. AI Query Optimization

**Make Your Queries Faster**

AI analyzes your queries and suggests optimizations:

- Index recommendations
- JOIN optimization
- Subquery improvements
- Performance tuning

```
Original: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN 
          (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE status = 'active')

Optimized: SELECT o.* FROM orders o
           INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
           WHERE c.status = 'active'
           
-- Explanation: Replaced subquery with JOIN for better performance
```

### 4. AI Query Explanation

**Understand Complex Queries Instantly**

Get detailed explanations of what any SQL query does:

```
Query: SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
       FROM customers c
       LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
       GROUP BY c.id, c.name;

AI Explanation: "This query retrieves all customers along with their 
total order count. It uses a LEFT JOIN to include customers who have 
no orders (showing 0), and groups results by customer ID and name to 
aggregate order counts per customer."
```

### 5. AI Dashboard Analyzer

**Automatic Data Visualization**

After running a query, AI analyzes the results and suggests optimal visualizations:

**Features:**
- **Automatic Chart Detection**: Identifies trends, distributions, and relationships
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Line, Bar, Pie, Scatter, Heatmap, Histogram, Boxplot
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests 4-10 visualizations based on data structure
- **Custom Instructions**: Guide AI on what visualizations you need

**Example:**

```
Query Result: Sales data by month and region

AI Suggestions:
1. Line Chart: Sales trend over time
2. Bar Chart: Sales by region comparison
3. Pie Chart: Region distribution
4. Heatmap: Month vs Region sales matrix
5. Scatter Plot: Sales vs Growth correlation
```

### 6. AI Schema Understanding

**Context-Aware Intelligence**

The AI system understands your entire database structure:

- **Full Schema Awareness**: Knows all tables, columns, and relationships
- **Table Selection**: Attach specific tables for focused query generation
- **Relationship Detection**: Understands foreign keys and JOIN opportunities
- **Sample Data Analysis**: Uses actual data patterns to improve suggestions

### 7. AI Conversation Context

**Remember Your Workflow**

The AI maintains conversation context:

- **Session Management**: Tracks ongoing conversations
- **Query History**: Remembers previous queries in the session
- **Context Preservation**: Builds on previous interactions
- **Multi-turn Refinement**: Iteratively improve queries through conversation

**Example Workflow:**

```
User: "Show me customer orders"
AI: [Generates query with customer and orders JOIN]

User: "Add total spent per customer"
AI: [Modifies query to include SUM aggregation]

User: "Only show customers with > 10 orders"
AI: [Adds HAVING clause with order count filter]
```

### 8. AI Confidence Scoring

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

-- In Aries Edition: Just paste and run!
-- Automatically compiled to:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

### Example 2: AI Query Generation

**Scenario**: You want to find the top 10 customers by revenue.

```
Step 1: Open AI Query Assistant (Ctrl+Shift+A)
Step 2: Select "customers" and "orders" tables
Step 3: Enter prompt: "Show top 10 customers by total revenue"
Step 4: AI generates:
```

```sql
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.name,
    c.email,
    SUM(o.total) as total_revenue
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Confidence: 95%
-- Complexity: Medium
```

### Example 3: Complex Multi-Table Query

**Scenario**: You need sales data with customer and product information.

```
AI Prompt: "Show monthly sales with customer names and product names, 
filter for last 6 months, group by month and customer"

AI Generated Query:
```

```sql
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', o.order_date) as month,
    c.name as customer_name,
    p.name as product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) as monthly_sales
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.order_date >= date('now', '-6 months')
GROUP BY month, c.name, p.name
ORDER BY month DESC, monthly_sales DESC;
```

### Example 4: Query Optimization

**Scenario**: Your query is slow, need optimization.

```
Original Query:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN 
(SELECT id FROM customers WHERE status = 'active' AND city = 'NYC');

AI Optimization Suggestion:
